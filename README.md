Fire up your browser and head to [Aedict Online](https://www.aedict-online.eu) - an online clone of the Android Aedict. Be warned - it is still in the Alpha phase though :)

## Aedict 2 Sources

This is the original repository of the old Aedict 2 code base. Aedict 2 is no longer maintained by me, but I have open-sourced the sources under GPL3. Please feel
free to check them out. Beware - the sources are very old, the build system uses an unofficial Maven plugin, so there is no guarantee that you will be able
to build the app.

The sources are open-sourced under the [GPL3 license](LICENSE.txt).
