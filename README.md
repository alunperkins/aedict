# Aedict

This is the original repository of the old Aedict 2 code base. However,
you can use the [Aedict Issue Tracker](https://github.com/mvysny/aedict/issues) to also report bugs for Aedict 3.

## Use Aedict 3 on your desktop

Fire up your browser and head to [Aedict Online](https://www.aedict-online.eu) - an online clone of the Android Aedict. Be warned - it is still in the Alpha phase though :) 

## Aedict Ultimate

Aedict is now subscription-based, to help fund further development. Please read more at the [Aedict Blog](https://mvysny.github.io/aedict-blog/), the [Aedict Ultimate Blogpost](https://mvysny.github.io/aedict-blog/Aedict-Ultimate/).
