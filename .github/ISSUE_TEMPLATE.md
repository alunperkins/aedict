### Thank you for making the time to report a bug and make Aedict better!

Thank you for your interest in Aedict. Prior submitting bugs, please make sure that you have newest Aedict from Google Play.

A screenshot is often worth a thousand words, so please make sure to include one ;)

Please provide:
1. Your phone brand and maker
2. The exact Android version.
3. A screenshot if possible; even better, a youtube video demonstrating the issue.
4. A full description of the issue you're experiencing. For example: I used to read manga with the MangaReader Android app, while having the Aedict Reader popup floating. I could click the Reader window, select word search and type in the word to look up. Now the virtual keyboard doesn't pop up. You suck :-D
